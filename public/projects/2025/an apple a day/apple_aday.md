oil pastels on paper, 42 x 29,7 cm each

i am too much  

i can change for you  

i can't tell what's good and what's right  

i desire to be desired  

i have been through the pen and through the sword  

it feels like everything is made out of me but myself  

sometimes i feel very foreign  

i have so many facets  

i love the past because i hate suspense
